# DTP_ITB Code Repository

## OncoKB
The OncoKB section contains the Python ETL as well as the instructions on how to run it.


## Plotting
The plotting section contains examples and proofs of concept on how to utilize a popular Plotting library called Plotly along with its full web implementation, Dash.  The Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) can be viewed in the browser for code examples.  The code is sanitized, so connection strings, usernames, and passwords will have to be located by personal communication.
